# Contributing Guidelines

This file contains guidelines for contributing to the programming language cheatsheets.

## General Guidelines

1. Each language should have its own directory
2. Use clear and concise markdown formatting
3. Include code examples where appropriate
4. Break down complex topics into manageable sections
5. Keep information up-to-date with latest language versions

## File Structure

Each language directory should contain separate markdown files for different topics:

- `basics.md` - Language fundamentals
- `data-structures.md` - Common data structures
- `algorithms.md` - Common algorithms
- `best-practices.md` - Best practices and style guides
- `interview-prep.md` - Common interview questions and solutions

## Markdown Style

- Use appropriate headers (H1, H2, H3)
- Code blocks should specify the language for syntax highlighting
- Include comments in code examples
- Use tables where appropriate for comparing features
